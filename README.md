# Estimator
Simple application to plan data transfers.
## Main Functionalities:
### Time Estimator
Enter Size of a file or folder and the speed you can transfer them at, the app calculates the required time.
### Data Estimator
Enter the speed at which you can transfer/download files and the time window you have for that transfer, the app calculates the size of possible data transfers.
## Features:
* Choose units, the app does the math.
* Accurate: uses Kibibytes which is 1024 bytes instead if 1000 bytes, but it refers to it as Kilobytes since it's more known to the average user.
* If you have a transfer that is already in progress, you can specify the completed percentage.
* You can test the transfer/download speed right from the app.
* Dark mode
